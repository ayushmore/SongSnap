# SongSnap
SongSnap is a web application that allows users to enter the title and artist of a song, which then generates a summary of the song lyrics using OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities. The application also leverages the Genius API to search for the song's lyrics.

## Technologies Used
SongSnap is built using the following technologies:

- Python
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- OpenAI API
- Genius API
- Vercel

## Usage
To use SongSnap, simply go to mysongsnap.com and enter the title and artist of a song. Choose the length of the summary you want, and click "Generate". The application will then generate a summary of the song lyrics.

## Features
MySongSnap comes with the following features:

- Summarize song lyrics
- Search for lyrics using the Genius API
- Customize summary length
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Deployment on Vercel for easy access


## How it Works
SongSnap works by taking the user's input for the song's title and artist, and using the Genius API to search for the lyrics of the song. Once the lyrics are found, the application uses OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities to generate a summary of the song.

## Deployment
SongSnap is deployed on Vercel at mysongsnap.com. The application is built using Flask, and uses Vercel's serverless functions to communicate with the OpenAI and Genius APIs. The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
